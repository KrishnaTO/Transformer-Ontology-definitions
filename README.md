# Transformer-Ontology-definitions
Build definitions by pretrained transformer using domain papers

Source idea from: https://transformer.huggingface.co/doc/gpt2-large

1. Perform pretraining on domain-based, or meta-database article search engine sourced, articles
2. Building definition can start from  'genus-differentia' form and use prediction results to choose or accept definition, subject to probability score thresholding.
